## Problem Description
```
Given a linked list and a value x, partition it such that all nodes less than x come before nodes greater than or equal to x.

You should preserve the original relative order of the nodes in each of the two partitions.

Example:

Input: head = 1->4->3->2->5->2, x = 3
Output: 1->2->2->4->3->5
```

## Thought
- Split list to two smaller lists
- Merge them at the end

## Keypoints
- Linked List


## Code
* Language: Java

```Java
class Solution {
    public ListNode partition(ListNode head, int x) {
        ListNode dummy1 = new ListNode(0), dummy2 = new ListNode(0);
        ListNode smallHead = dummy1, bigHead = dummy2;
        
        while(head != null){
            if(head.val < x){
                smallHead.next = head;
                smallHead = smallHead.next;
            }else{
                bigHead.next = head;
                bigHead = bigHead.next;
            }
            head = head.next;
        }
        //prevent loop if big element has next element < x
        bigHead.next = null;
        smallHead.next = dummy2.next;
        return dummy1.next;
    }
}
```
