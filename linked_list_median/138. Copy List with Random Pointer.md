## Problem Source
https://leetcode.com/problems/copy-list-with-random-pointer/

## Problem Description
```
A linked list is given such that each node contains an additional random pointer which could point to any node in the list or null.

Return a deep copy of the list.

The Linked List is represented in the input/output as a list of n nodes. Each node is represented as a pair of [val, random_index] where:

val: an integer representing Node.val
random_index: the index of the node (range from 0 to n-1) where random pointer points to, or null if it does not point to any node.
 

Example 1:


Input: head = [[7,null],[13,0],[11,4],[10,2],[1,0]]
Output: [[7,null],[13,0],[11,4],[10,2],[1,0]]
Example 2:


Input: head = [[1,1],[2,1]]
Output: [[1,1],[2,1]]
Example 3:



Input: head = [[3,null],[3,0],[3,null]]
Output: [[3,null],[3,0],[3,null]]
Example 4:

Input: head = []
Output: []
Explanation: Given linked list is empty (null pointer), so return null.
 
```

## Thought
- All we do in this approach is to just traverse the graph and clone it. Cloning essentially means creating a new node for every unseen node you encounter. 
- The traversal part will happen recursively in a depth first manner. Note that we have to keep track of nodes already processed because, as pointed out earlier, we can have cycles because of the random pointers.


## Keypoints
- Recursive,  graph


## Code
* Language: Java

```Java
class Solution {
    Map<Node, Node> visitedNode = new HashMap<>();
    
    public Node copyRandomList(Node head) {
        if(head == null) return null;
        
        if(this.visitedNode.containsKey(head)) 
            return this.visitedNode.get(head);
        
        Node cloneNode = new Node(head.val, null, null);
        this.visitedNode.put(head,cloneNode);
        
        cloneNode.next = this.copyRandomList(head.next);
        cloneNode.random = this.copyRandomList(head.random);
        
        return cloneNode;
    }
}
```
