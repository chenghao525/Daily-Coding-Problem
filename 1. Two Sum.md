## Problem Description
```
Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

Example:

Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9, 
return [0, 1].
```

## Thought
- Use HashMap to store each value as key and index as value
- Subtract current value and look up in HashMap to see if there is a match

## Keypoints
- HashMap


## Code
* Language: Java

```Java
class Solution {
    public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
        Map<Integer, Integer> sumMap = new HashMap<Integer, Integer>();
        int[] output = new int[2];
        
        for(int i=0;i<nums.length;i++){
            int diff = target - nums[i];
            if(sumMap.containsKey(diff)){
                output[0] = sumMap.get(diff);
                output[1] = i;
            }else{
                sumMap.put(nums[i],i);
            }
        }
        return output;
    }
}
```
