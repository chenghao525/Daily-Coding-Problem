## Problem Description
```
Given a binary array, find the maximum number of consecutive 1s in this array.

Example 1:
Input: [1,1,0,1,1,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: The first two digits or the last three digits are consecutive 1s.
    The maximum number of consecutive 1s is 3.
Note:

The input array will only contain 0 and 1.
The length of input array is a positive integer and will not exceed 10,000
```

## Thought
- Use count to keep track of the max concecutive 1's
- One pass

## Keypoints
- Count


## Code
* Language: Java

```Java
class Solution {
    public int findMaxConsecutiveOnes(int[] nums) {
        int count = 0, maxCount = 0;
        
        for(int i=0;i<nums.length;i++){
            if(nums[i]==1){
                count++;
            }else{
                maxCount = Math.max(count, maxCount);
                count = 0;
            }
            maxCount = Math.max(count, maxCount);
        }
        return maxCount;
    }
}
```

***Complexity***

- Time Complexity：O(N), where N is the length of nums.
- Space Complexity：O(1)
