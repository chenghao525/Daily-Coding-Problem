## Problem Description
```
You are climbing a stair case. It takes n steps to reach to the top.

Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

Example 1:

Input: 2
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step
2. 2 steps
Example 2:

Input: 3
Output: 3
Explanation: There are three ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
2. 1 step + 2 steps
3. 2 steps + 1 step
```

## Thought
- One can reach ith step in one of the two ways:
- Taking a single step from (i-1)th step.
- Taking a step of 22 from (i-2)th step.
- So, the total number of ways to reach ith is equal to sum of ways of reaching (i-1)th  step and ways of reaching (i-2)th step.

## Keypoints
- Dynamic programming


## Code
* Language: Java

```Java
class Solution {
    public int climbStairs(int n) {
        if(n == 1)return 1;
        int[] dp = new int[n+1];
        
        dp[1] = 1;
        dp[2] = 2;
        
        for(int i=3;i<n+1;i++){
            dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2];
        }
        return dp[n];
    }
}
```
