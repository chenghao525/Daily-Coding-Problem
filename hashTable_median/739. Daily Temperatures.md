## Problem Description
```
Given a list of daily temperatures T, return a list such that, for each day in the input, tells you how many days you would have to wait until a warmer temperature. If there is no future day for which this is possible, put 0 instead.

For example, given the list of temperatures T = [73, 74, 75, 71, 69, 72, 76, 73], your output should be [1, 1, 4, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0].

Note: The length of temperatures will be in the range [1, 30000]. Each temperature will be an integer in the range [30, 100].
```

## Thought
- For loop through the temps from index 0
- Use Stack to store the index if not found higher temp yet
- while loop to check element in stack to update res[]


## Keypoints
- Stack


## Code
* Language: Java

```Java
class Solution {
    public int[] dailyTemperatures(int[] T) {
        Stack<Integer> tempStack = new Stack<>();
        int[] res = new int[T.length];
        
        for(int i=0;i<T.length;i++){
            while(!tempStack.empty() && T[i] > T[tempStack.peek()]){
                int index = tempStack.pop();
                res[index] = i - index;
            }
            tempStack.push(i);
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```
