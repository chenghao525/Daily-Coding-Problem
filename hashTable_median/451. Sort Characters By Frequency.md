## Problem Source
https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-characters-by-frequency/

## Problem Description
```
Given a string, sort it in decreasing order based on the frequency of characters.

Example 1:

Input:
"tree"

Output:
"eert"

Explanation:
'e' appears twice while 'r' and 't' both appear once.
So 'e' must appear before both 'r' and 't'. Therefore "eetr" is also a valid answer.
Example 2:

Input:
"cccaaa"

Output:
"cccaaa"

Explanation:
Both 'c' and 'a' appear three times, so "aaaccc" is also a valid answer.
Note that "cacaca" is incorrect, as the same characters must be together.
Example 3:

Input:
"Aabb"

Output:
"bbAa"

Explanation:
"bbaA" is also a valid answer, but "Aabb" is incorrect.
Note that 'A' and 'a' are treated as two different characters.
```

## Thought
- Use HashMap to store each char's frequency
- Use bucket to store char's with same frequency to each entry
- Iterate from end of bucket and use string builder to build the string

## Keypoints
- HashMap, bucket


## Code
* Language: Java

```Java
class Solution {
    public String frequencySort(String s) {
        Map<Character, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        
        for(char c : s.toCharArray()){
            map.put(c,map.getOrDefault(c, 0) + 1);
        }
        
        List<Character>[] bucket = new List[s.length() + 1];
        
        for(char key : map.keySet()){
            int frequency = map.get(key);
            if(bucket[frequency] == null) bucket[frequency] = new ArrayList<>();
            bucket[frequency].add(key);
        }
        
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        for(int i = bucket.length-1; i >= 0; i--){
            if(bucket[i] != null)
                for(char c:bucket[i])
                    for (int j = 0; j < i; j++)
                        sb.append(c);
        }
        return sb.toString();
    }
}
```
