## Problem Description
```
Given a string s and a non-empty string p, find all the start indices of p's anagrams in s.

Strings consists of lowercase English letters only and the length of both strings s and p will not be larger than 20,100.

The order of output does not matter.

Example 1:

Input:
s: "cbaebabacd" p: "abc"

Output:
[0, 6]

Explanation:
The substring with start index = 0 is "cba", which is an anagram of "abc".
The substring with start index = 6 is "bac", which is an anagram of "abc".
Example 2:

Input:
s: "abab" p: "ab"

Output:
[0, 1, 2]

Explanation:
The substring with start index = 0 is "ab", which is an anagram of "ab".
The substring with start index = 1 is "ba", which is an anagram of "ab".
The substring with start index = 2 is "ab", which is an anagram of "ab".
```

## Thought
- Use Sliding window to check length of p elemnts in s
- Move left and right indicator according to length of window
- Beacuse left and right point only go through the array once so O(N)

## Keypoints
- HashMap


## Code
* Language: Java

```Java
class Solution {
    public List<Integer> findAnagrams(String s, String p) {
        List<Integer> res = new ArrayList<>();
        if (s == null || s.length() == 0 || p == null || p.length() == 0) return res;
        int[] hash = new int[256];

        for (char c : p.toCharArray()) hash[c]++;
        
        int left = 0, right = 0, count = p.length();
        while(right < s.length()){
            if(hash[s.charAt(right++)]-- >= 1) count--;
            if(count == 0) res.add(left);
            if(right - left == p.length() && hash[s.charAt(left++)]++ >= 0) count++;
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```

***Complexity***

- Time Complexity：O(N)
- Space Complexity：O(1)
