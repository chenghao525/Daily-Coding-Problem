## Problem Description
```
On an infinite plane, a robot initially stands at (0, 0) and faces north.  The robot can receive one of three instructions:

"G": go straight 1 unit;
"L": turn 90 degrees to the left;
"R": turn 90 degress to the right.
The robot performs the instructions given in order, and repeats them forever.

Return true if and only if there exists a circle in the plane such that the robot never leaves the circle.

 

Example 1:

Input: "GGLLGG"
Output: true
Explanation: 
The robot moves from (0,0) to (0,2), turns 180 degrees, and then returns to (0,0).
When repeating these instructions, the robot remains in the circle of radius 2 centered at the origin.
Example 2:

Input: "GG"
Output: false
Explanation: 
The robot moves north indefinitely.
Example 3:

Input: "GL"
Output: true
Explanation: 
The robot moves from (0, 0) -> (0, 1) -> (-1, 1) -> (-1, 0) -> (0, 0) -> ...

```

## Thought
- Use array to record directions
- Move coordinte according to direction
- X=0 && y=0 means return to origin
- not face north after the instruction will lead robot back to origin eventually after 4 cycles

## Keypoints
- Math


## Code
* Language: Java

```Java
class Solution {
    public boolean isRobotBounded(String instructions) {
        //North = 0, east = 1, south = 2, west = 3
        int[][] directions = new int[][]{{0,1},{1,0},{0,-1},{-1,0}};
        int dir = 0,x=0,y=0;
        
        for(char c:instructions.toCharArray()){
            if(c=='L'){
                dir = (3 + dir) % 4;
            }else if(c=='R'){
                dir = (1 + dir) % 4;
            }else{
                x += directions[dir][0];
                y += directions[dir][1];
            }
        }
        return (x==0&&y==0)||dir!=0;
    }
}
```
