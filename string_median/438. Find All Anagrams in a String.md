## Problem Description
```
Given a string s and a non-empty string p, find all the start indices of p's anagrams in s.

Strings consists of lowercase English letters only and the length of both strings s and p will not be larger than 20,100.

The order of output does not matter.

Example 1:

Input:
s: "cbaebabacd" p: "abc"

Output:
[0, 6]

Explanation:
The substring with start index = 0 is "cba", which is an anagram of "abc".
The substring with start index = 6 is "bac", which is an anagram of "abc".
Example 2:

Input:
s: "abab" p: "ab"

Output:
[0, 1, 2]

Explanation:
The substring with start index = 0 is "ab", which is an anagram of "ab".
The substring with start index = 1 is "ba", which is an anagram of "ab".
The substring with start index = 2 is "ab", which is an anagram of "ab".

```

## Thought
- Use array to store char in p
- Use sliding window to compare if char in p

## Keypoints
- Sliding window


## Code
* Language: Java

```Java
class Solution {
    public List<Integer> findAnagrams(String s, String p) {
        List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<Integer>();
        
        int[] hash = new int[256];
        
        for(char c:p.toCharArray()){
            hash[c]++;
        }
        
        int start = 0, end = 0, count = p.length();
        while(end < s.length()){
            if(hash[s.charAt(end++)]-->=1) count--;
            if(count==0)result.add(start);
            if(end-start==p.length() && hash[s.charAt(start++)]++ >= 0)
                count++;
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```
