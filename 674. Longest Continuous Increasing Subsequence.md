## Problem Description
```
Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of longest continuous increasing subsequence (subarray).

Example 1:
Input: [1,3,5,4,7]
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest continuous increasing subsequence is [1,3,5], its length is 3. 
Even though [1,3,5,7] is also an increasing subsequence, it's not a continuous one where 5 and 7 are separated by 4. 
Example 2:
Input: [2,2,2,2,2]
Output: 1
Explanation: The longest continuous increasing subsequence is [2], its length is 1. + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1].
```

## Thought
- Iterate through array and compare.
- Update count and compare max.

## Keypoints
- Count


## Code
* Language: Java

```Java
class Solution {
    public int findLengthOfLCIS(int[] nums) {
        int res=0, count=0;
        
        for(int i=0;i<nums.length;i++){
            if(i==0 || nums[i]>nums[i-1]) res=Math.max(res, ++count);
            else count=1;
        }
        
        return res;
    }
}
```
