## Problem Description
```
Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters char[].

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

You may assume all the characters consist of printable ascii characters.

 

Example 1:

Input: ["h","e","l","l","o"]
Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]
Example 2:

Input: ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]
Output: ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]
```

## Thought
- Two pointer, one at the beginning, one at the end
- Swap the letter on the pointer and go middle

## Keypoints
- Two pointer


## Code
* Language: Java

```Java
class Solution {
    public void reverseString(char[] s) {
        int left = 0, right = s.length -1;
        
        while(left < right){
            char tmp = s[left];
            s[left++] = s[right];
            s[right--] = tmp;
        }
    }
}
```

***Complexity***

- Time Complexity：O(N)
- Space Complexity：O(1)
