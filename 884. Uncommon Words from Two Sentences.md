## Problem Source
https://leetcode.com/problems/uncommon-words-from-two-sentences/

## Problem Description
```
We are given two sentences A and B.  (A sentence is a string of space separated words.  Each word consists only of lowercase letters.)

A word is uncommon if it appears exactly once in one of the sentences, and does not appear in the other sentence.

Return a list of all uncommon words. 

You may return the list in any order.

 

Example 1:

Input: A = "this apple is sweet", B = "this apple is sour"
Output: ["sweet","sour"]
Example 2:

Input: A = "apple apple", B = "banana"
Output: ["banana"]
```

## Thought
- Use HashMap to store each word as key and count of word as value
- Return those count of 1

## Keypoints
- HashMap


## Code
* Language: Java

```Java
class Solution {
    public String[] uncommonFromSentences(String A, String B) {
        Map<String, Integer> countMap = new HashMap();
        
        for(String word: A.split(" ")){
            countMap.put(word, countMap.getOrDefault(word,0)+1);
        }
        for(String word: B.split(" ")){
            countMap.put(word, countMap.getOrDefault(word,0)+1);
        }
        List<String> res = new LinkedList();
        for(String key:countMap.keySet()){
            if(countMap.get(key) == 1) res.add(key);
        }
        return res.toArray(new String[res.size()]);
    }
}
```

***Complexity***

- Time Complexity：O(M+N), where M,N are the lengths of A and B respectively.
- Space Complexity：O(M+N), the space used by countMap.
