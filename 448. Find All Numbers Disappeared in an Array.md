## Problem Description
```
Given an array of integers where 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ n (n = size of array), some elements appear twice and others appear once.

Find all the elements of [1, n] inclusive that do not appear in this array.

Could you do it without extra space and in O(n) runtime? You may assume the returned list does not count as extra space.

Example:

Input:
[4,3,2,7,8,2,3,1]

Output:
[5,6]
```

## Thought
- For each element nums[i], mark the element at the corresponding location negative if it's not already marked.
- Now, loop over numbers from 1⋯N and for each number check if nums[j] is negative. If it is negative, that means we've seen this number somewhere in the array.

## Keypoints
- Mark the index position

## Code
* Language: Java

```Java
class Solution {
    public List<Integer> findDisappearedNumbers(int[] nums) {
        
        for(int i=0;i<nums.length;i++){
            int newIndex = Math.abs(nums[i]) - 1;
            
            if(nums[newIndex] > 0){
                nums[newIndex] *= -1; 
            }
        }
        
        List<Integer> result = new LinkedList<Integer>();
        
        for (int i = 1; i <= nums.length; i++) {
            if (nums[i - 1] > 0) {
                result.add(i);
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```

***Complexity***

- Time Complexity：O(N)
- Space Complexity：O(1)
