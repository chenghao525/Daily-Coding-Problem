## Problem Description
```
Given two lists of closed intervals, each list of intervals is pairwise disjoint and in sorted order.

Return the intersection of these two interval lists.

(Formally, a closed interval [a, b] (with a <= b) denotes the set of real numbers x with a <= x <= b.  The intersection of two closed intervals is a set of real numbers that is either empty, or can be represented as a closed interval.  For example, the intersection of [1, 3] and [2, 4] is [2, 3].)

 

Example 1:



Input: A = [[0,2],[5,10],[13,23],[24,25]], B = [[1,5],[8,12],[15,24],[25,26]]
Output: [[1,2],[5,5],[8,10],[15,23],[24,24],[25,25]]
```

## Thought
- Use two pointers to iterate through A and B, get the long sencond interval
- Match to three cases, not include, partially include and all included
- increment i or j according for lower second interval

## Keypoints
- Two pointer


## Code
* Language: Java

```Java
class Solution {
    
    public int[][] intervalIntersection(int[][] A, int[][] B) {
        int i=0,j=0;
        List<int[]> res = new ArrayList<>(); 
        while(i<A.length && j<B.length){
            if(A[i][1] >= B[j][1]){
                if(helper(A[i],B[j]) != null)
                    res.add(helper(A[i],B[j]));
                j++;
            }else{
                if(helper(B[j],A[i]) != null)
                    res.add(helper(B[j],A[i]));
                i++;
            }
        }
        
        return res.toArray(new int[res.size()][]);
    }
    
    public int[] helper(int[] A, int[] B){
        //No intersect
        if(B[1] < A[0]){
            return null;
        }else if(B[0] <= A[0] && B[1] <= A[1]){
            return new int[]{A[0],B[1]};
        }else{
            return new int[]{B[0],B[1]};
        }
    }
}
```
