## Problem Source
https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/

## Problem Description
```
Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

Example 1:

Input: "abcabcbb"
Output: 3 
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3. 
Example 2:

Input: "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
Example 3:

Input: "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3. 
             Note that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
```

## Thought
- Use HashMap to store char and position pair
- Use two pointer to keep track of the longest substring without repeat

## Keypoints
- HashMap, two pointer


## Code
* Language: Java

```Java
class Solution {
    public int lengthOfLongestSubstring(String s) {
        Map<Character, Integer> m = new HashMap<>();
        if(s.length()==0)return 0;
        int max = 0;
        for(int i=0,j=0;i<s.length();i++){
            if(m.containsKey(s.charAt(i))){
                j=Math.max(j, m.get(s.charAt(i))+1);
            }
            m.put(s.charAt(i),i);
            max = Math.max(max, i-j+1);
        }
        return max;
    }
}
```
