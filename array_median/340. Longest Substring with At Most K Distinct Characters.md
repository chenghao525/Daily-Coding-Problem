## Problem Source
https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-with-at-most-k-distinct-characters/

## Problem Description
```
Given a string, find the length of the longest substring T that contains at most k distinct characters.

Example 1:

Input: s = "eceba", k = 2
Output: 3
Explanation: T is "ece" which its length is 3.
Example 2:

Input: s = "aa", k = 1
Output: 2
Explanation: T is "aa" which its length is 2.
```

## Thought
- Use num to track the number of distinct characters within the slide window
- Keep track of num of distincts

## Keypoints
- Sliding Window


## Code
* Language: Java

```Java
class Solution {
    public int lengthOfLongestSubstringKDistinct(String s, int k) {
        int[] count = new int[256];
        int num = 0;
        int res = 0;
        
        for(int j=0, i=0;j<s.length();j++){
            if(count[s.charAt(j)]++ == 0) num++;
            if(num > k){
                while(--count[s.charAt(i++)] > 0);
                num--;
            }
            res = Math.max(res, j - i + 1);
        }
        return res;    
    }
}
