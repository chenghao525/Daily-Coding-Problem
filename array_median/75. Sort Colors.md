## Problem Description
```
Given an array with n objects colored red, white or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white and blue.

Here, we will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue respectively.

Note: You are not suppose to use the library's sort function for this problem.

Example:

Input: [2,0,2,1,1,0]
Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]
```

## Thought
- Use three pointer to track location of left right and current
- Put all zeros to left, all twos to right and leave ones in the middle

## Keypoints
- Three pointers


## Code
* Language: Java

```Java
class Solution {
    public void sortColors(int[] nums) {
        int left = 0, right = nums.length -1, current = 0;
        
        while(current <= right){
            if(nums[current] == 0){
                nums[current] = nums[left];
                nums[left] = 0;
                left++;
                current++;
            }else if(nums[current] == 2){
                nums[current] = nums[right];
                nums[right] = 2;
                right--;   
            }else{
                current++;
            }
        }
    }
}
```
