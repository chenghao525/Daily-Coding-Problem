## Problem Description
```
Given a 2d grid map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), count the number of islands. An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

 

Example 1:

Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","1","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","0","0"]
]
Output: 1
Example 2:

Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","1","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","1","1"]
]
Output: 3

```

## Thought
- Use DFS to track island
- Change 1 to 2 if visited

## Keypoints
- DFS


## Code
* Language: Java

```Java
class Solution {
    public int numIslands(char[][] grid) {
        int count = 0;
        
        for(int i = 0;i < grid.length; i++){
            for(int j=0;j<grid[i].length;j++){
                if(grid[i][j] == '1'){
                    myDFS(grid, i, j);
                    count++;
                }
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
    
    private void myDFS(char[][] grid, int x, int y){
        int rows = grid.length;
        int cols = grid[0].length;
        
        if(x<0||x>=rows||y<0||y>=cols||grid[x][y] == '2'||grid[x][y] == '0') return;
        
        if(grid[x][y] == '1') grid[x][y] = '2';
        
        myDFS(grid, x+1,y);
        myDFS(grid, x-1,y);
        myDFS(grid, x,y+1);
        myDFS(grid, x,y-1);
    }
}
```

***Complexity***

- Time Complexity：O(M+N) where M is number of rows, N is number of columns
- Space Complexity：O(M+N)
