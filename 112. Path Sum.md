## Problem Description
```
Given a binary tree and a sum, determine if the tree has a root-to-leaf path such that adding up all the values along the path equals the given sum.

Note: A leaf is a node with no children.

Example:

Given the below binary tree and sum = 22,

      5
     / \
    4   8
   /   / \
  11  13  4
 /  \      \
7    2      1
return true, as there exist a root-to-leaf path 5->4->11->2 which sum is 22.
```

## Thought
- Use recursion to examine each root to leaf path
- Subtract the node value from sum to make a new case

## Keypoints
- Recursion
- Subtract sum

## Code
* Language: Java

```Java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode() {}
 *     TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
 *         this.val = val;
 *         this.left = left;
 *         this.right = right;
 *     }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public boolean hasPathSum(TreeNode root, int sum) {
        if (root == null)
            return false;

        sum -= root.val;
        if ((root.left == null) && (root.right == null))
            return (sum == 0);
        return hasPathSum(root.left, sum) || hasPathSum(root.right, sum);
    }
}
```

***Complexity***

- Time Complexity：O(N), where N is the number of nodes.
- Space Complexity：in the worst case, the tree is completely unbalanced, e.g. each node has only one child node, the recursion call would occur N times (the height of the tree), therefore the storage to keep the call stack would be O(N). But in the best case (the tree is completely balanced), the height of the tree would be 
log(N). Therefore, the space complexity in this case would be O(log(N)).
