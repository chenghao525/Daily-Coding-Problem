## Problem Description
```
Given two words (beginWord and endWord), and a dictionary's word list, find the length of shortest transformation sequence from beginWord to endWord, such that:

Only one letter can be changed at a time.
Each transformed word must exist in the word list.
Note:

Return 0 if there is no such transformation sequence.
All words have the same length.
All words contain only lowercase alphabetic characters.
You may assume no duplicates in the word list.
You may assume beginWord and endWord are non-empty and are not the same.
Example 1:

Input:
beginWord = "hit",
endWord = "cog",
wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log","cog"]

Output: 5

Explanation: As one shortest transformation is "hit" -> "hot" -> "dot" -> "dog" -> "cog",
return its length 5.
Example 2:

Input:
beginWord = "hit"
endWord = "cog"
wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log"]

Output: 0

Explanation: The endWord "cog" is not in wordList, therefore no possible transformation.
```

## Thought
- Use BFS to try every combination of word from changing one char of beginning word,
- put inside toadd and reached list if the word is in wordList, keep count the counts
- stop if reach the end word

## Keypoints
- BFS


## Code
* Language: Java

```Java
class Solution {
    public int ladderLength(String beginWord, String endWord, List<String> wordList) {
        //Use BFS to try every combination of word from changing one char of beginning word,
        //put inside toadd and reached list if the word is in wordList, keep count the counts
        //stop if reach the end word
        if(wordList.indexOf(endWord) == -1) return 0;
        Set<String> reached = new HashSet<>();
        reached.add(beginWord);
        Set<String> wordSet = new HashSet<>(wordList);
        
        int distance = 1;
        while (!reached.contains(endWord)) {
            Set<String> toAdd = new HashSet<String>();
            for (String each : reached) {
                for (int i = 0; i < each.length(); i++) {
                    char[] chars = each.toCharArray();
                    for (char ch = 'a'; ch <= 'z'; ch++) {
                        chars[i] = ch;
                        String word = new String(chars);
                        if (wordSet.contains(word)) {
                            toAdd.add(word);
                            wordSet.remove(word);
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
            distance++;
            if (toAdd.size() == 0) return 0;
            reached = toAdd;
        }
        return distance;
    }
}
```

***Complexity***

- Time Complexity：O(26 * N * L) N is the word in reached list, L is the length of the word, 26 char
- Space Complexity：O(N)
