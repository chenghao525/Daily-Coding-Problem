## Problem Description
```
Given a binary tree, you need to compute the length of the diameter of the tree. The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.

Example:
Given a binary tree
          1
         / \
        2   3
       / \     
      4   5    
Return 3, which is the length of the path [4,2,1,3] or [5,2,1,3].
```

## Thought
- Get the max left or right subtree path
- Update the global variable max_path with the max path

## Keypoints
- Tree, recursive


## Code
* Language: Java

```Java
class Solution {
    int max_path = 0;
    public int diameterOfBinaryTree(TreeNode root) {
        if(root == null)return 0;
        helper(root);
        return max_path-1;
    }
    
    public int helper(TreeNode root){
        if(root == null) return 0;
        int leftPath = helper(root.left);
        int rightPath = helper(root.right);
        max_path = Math.max(1+leftPath+rightPath, max_path);
        return 1 + Math.max(leftPath, rightPath);
    }
}
```
